# PercentChar
Scripts for encoding strings in URL/Percent encoding but breaking it down into individual encodings instead of as a string

## Javascript
This code is inteded to be used in something like Caido as a workflow, although there are probably other implementations im not thinking of.

## Bash 
This was for ease of use, I might eventually add a python script.

### Example Usage for Bash
```
url_per_char.sh "Hello, world!"
```
